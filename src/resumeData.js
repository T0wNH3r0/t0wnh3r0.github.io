      description: 'Lights',
      name: 'I did not know how important this can be to a home until I started this project.Once I saw the benefits, I wanted to outfit my entire home. The entire reason I started my smart home project was so that I could have lights toggle on and off based on my presence in a given room. It simply was not enough to be able to control them from my smart phone. Every time that I needed to turn lights on or off, I would need to track down my phone first and only after finding and opening the app could I turn my lights off. This seemed to defeat the purpose of having smart lights, when its just faster to get up and flip the switch manually. Once the proper setup to control the lights based on presence was in place, the need to flip switches and search for phones is now minimal at best. As it is now natural to no longer touch light switches on a day to day basis in a smart house, there are many benefits ranging from convenience (such as toggled lights) to hygiene (not having to touch bathroom or kitchen switches).'

      description: 'Sensors',
      name: ' As one of the main ingredients for making things work automatically, sensors are extremely important. With the use of motion detectors it is possible to have devices react upon entering a room, such lights or switches. I found this to be most advantageous not only for us, but also for our aging dog. He would have issues seeing the steps in the dark, or seeing the edge of furniture in dark rooms. This addressed the issue and made it a complete non issue, as even when we are not home he can have light wherever he needs to go, and once settled, after a certain period of time the lights turn themselves off. I am a firm believer that this has prevented many preventable accidents. Door and Window sensors give many options for automation as well, and through the use of notifications, can be an effective way to keep up with the comings and goings of the house.Moisture Sensors work well for detecting moisture where it should not be...such as the basement!'

      name: 'Location based comfort settings are extremely economical. Its pretty simple: adjust the temperature based on who is (or isn\'t) in the house.In addition to location based settings, having scheduled settings has also proven to be extremely effective at keeping everyone in the household comfortable.The smart thermostat market is growing, however the particular thermostat that I use is the Ecobee 3. Although the Ecobee 3 is a capable stand alone thermostat, its real power shines with integration into SmartThings for location based modes and use with voice assistants.'

      name:'Living in a house built in 1908, Needless to say in a home this old, every bit helps when it comes to heating and cooling. In our case, there were issues getting proper ventilation into the office, but yet there was air blasting unabashedly in the guest room. Adding smart vents fixed many issues we were having and now the guest room only gets full air flow if there is actually someone in there, and the office temperature stays regulated much better, as well as the rest of the rooms on the upper level.'

      name: 'While not only having extreme cool factor, the functional use of automated shades cannot be underestimated. Helping to regulate the temperature and light while also providing privacy, having the ability to control shades at will can be most beneficial. Now, instead of having to fight the sun during the morning hours, I have the shades open based on the sun\'s position, and if I need to change them, I can do so via voice control. Issue Resolved.'

There is an unmistakable peace of mind knowing right away if there is a detection in the house, especially with pets and loved ones residing within. Performing routine tests and battery checks becomes a breeze as the battery level gets reported to SmartThings and allows the siren to be tested with a simple tap.'

Choosing the right lock for the right smart home setup can make smart home living extremely convenient. Some offer digital keys that can be given and revoked as needed, while others offer notifications and built in alarms. At the most basic level for a smart house, I\'ve found most people want to know when their doors open and close.Knowledge is indeed power.'

From my own experience, I have noticed that as the number of "things" added to the network increases, the need to have a decent router also increased. Routers come in all forms and types, so its important to have one that scales with the size of the network of things that is being created.'

Through the use of wifi, it has never been easier to have sound dispersed throughout the home. Whether for music, ambiance or notifications, having the ability to direct sound where its needed can quickly become a necessity in any home.'
